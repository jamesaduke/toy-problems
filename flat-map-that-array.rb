# Create a method flat_map that accepts a list and a block, runs the block for each item in the list. It should return a new array with the block return values, and that array should be flattened (1-dimensional).

# If you need help, here's a reference (flat_map and collect_concat are the same):

# http://www.rubycuts.com/enum-collect-concat


def flat_map(list, &block)
	list.collect_concat(&block)
  # your solution here
